          I am a web developer that focuses on how to use marketing to grow
          brands. I understand the importance of not only getting the technical
          side of a project working, but also making sure that all the marketing
          channels work together to help your audience move smoothly through
          your funnel. I enjoy reading, traveling and learning new things that
          help me to better assist others.
