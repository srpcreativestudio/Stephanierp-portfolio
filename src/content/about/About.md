I am a web developer that focuses on how to use marketing to grow brands. I understand the importance of not only getting the technical side of a project working, but also making sure that all the marketing channels work together to help your audience move smoothly through your funnel. I enjoy reading, traveling and learning new things that help me to better assist others.
